> *"Such a general development cannot be attributed to the false tactics of any single party or to the mistakes of individual leaders. On the contrary, the conduct of individual leaders is determined largely by the sentiments of the people as a whole. It would be erroneous, however, to regard the sentiments of the moment as reflecting the natural make-up and character of the people. They are merely the consequence of the special circumstances which have brought about this profound degradation of the entire nation."*

This is a game of alternate history. While historical accuracy is a major concern, keep in mind that this is a *game*, and that any divergence from actual events will necessarily have to involve some element of make-believe. Nevertheless, please let the author know if there are any glaring mistakes.

Experimental support changes enabled. These will likely lead to more uniform changes in support, rather than support becoming more static in the lategame. However, the game isn't currently adjusted for this, so it may also lead to unexpected margins.

Note: After some playtests, they seem to inexplicably just lead to the Nazis never growing. Not recommended.

It is a bright time for German democracy. After a period of struggle, inflation is finally under control, and the economy is expanding steadily. In foreign policy, we have reached agreements with the Western powers and the Soviet Union that might make genuine peace a reality. 

Now, the task of Social Democracy is to prepare for the next election. The bourgeois-right government of Wilhelm Marx is unpopular, and we stand to gain. Perhaps the next government will have a socialist majority.

It is a grim time for German democracy. Following the largest crash in the stock market the world has seen, a worldwide depression has started, hitting Germany especially hard. The Nazis are ascendant and our support is dwindling as our coalition nears collapse. 

It will be our responsibility to ensure that this crisis of capitalism will not end so badly for the working class.

It is an uncertain time for German democracy. Though the crises of 1923 have subsided and given way to a stabilization and normalization, the bourgeois parties continue to shift to the right to exclude us from government, even including the anticonstitutional DNVP in the form of the Luther cabinet which has just assumed power. 

The task of Social Democracy is to prepare itself so that when the government inevitably falls due to disagreements between the left and right of the bourgeois parties, we will be seen by the workers of Germany a viable alternative.
